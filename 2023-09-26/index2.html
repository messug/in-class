What can i say after i graduated high school i choose stream to pursue my education after a year of taking course which is freshman courses i got 2.9 Gpa and i had a list of study to pursue from education to doctor. So i chose nursing and lab technician but that didn't work out instead the thing that i really hated comes which is biology education. After a lot of thinking and the young desires I started it and got some friends and I was able to finish it even though lots of people didn't expect me to finish it but I did it and it was worthy and satisfying.
Being a good daughter and sister and teacher at the highschool i was teaching.
After i'm one with my education I was supposed to be a teacher and I became one and I got to go to some place far from home as a teacher. They didn't have much english teacher so they told me i have to be one i said okay and started to teach the students english.i loved the kids and i was super focus with them and i was doing the best of my ability.I wasn't only teaching but giving them advice about life because at some point of my life i was not happy and would have done different like helping family and having hobbies. So I was speaking to them about life. I had a hobby for public speaking so I was comfortable.To my  surprise I was able to see them all quiet and still and focussed to what I was speaking and I was shocked and happy to see them all listening to my words. That was the happiest day of my life.
Self teaching myself  lots of skills </p>
